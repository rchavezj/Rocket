/// This type is the only means by which the body of a request can be retrieved.
/// This type is not usually used directly. Instead, types that implement
/// [`FromData`](crate::data::FromData) are used via code generation by
/// specifying the `data = "<var>"` route parameter as follows:
///
/// ```rust
/// # #![feature(proc_macro_hygiene)]
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate rocket;
/// # type DataGuard = rocket::data::Data;
/// #[post("/submit", data = "<var>")]
/// fn submit(var: DataGuard) { /* ... */ }
/// # fn main() { }
/// ```
///
/// Above, `DataGuard` can be any type that implements `FromData`. Note that
/// `Data` itself implements `FromData`.
///
/// # Reading Data
///
/// Data may be read from a `Data` object by calling either the
/// [`open()`](Data::open()) or [`peek()`](Data::peek()) methods.
///
/// The `open` method consumes the `Data` object and returns the raw data
/// stream. The `Data` object is consumed for safety reasons: consuming the
/// object ensures that holding a `Data` object means that all of the data is
/// available for reading.
///
/// The `peek` method returns a slice containing at most 512 bytes of buffered
/// body data. This enables partially or fully reading from a `Data` object
/// without consuming the `Data` object.

    /// instance. This ensures that a `Data` type _always_ represents _all_ of
    /// the data in a request.
    ///
    /// # Example
